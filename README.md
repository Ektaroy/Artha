## Problem Statement

<br/>
<blockquote align='center'>
<h3>

"1 in 3 adults struggle with basic financial literacy."

\- Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)
</h3>
</blockquote>
<br/>


As per recent studies by the Global Financial Literacy Excellence Center (GFLEC), over 33% of adults worldwide struggle with basic financial literacy. This widespread lack of financial knowledge contributes to significant challenges such as debt accumulation, inadequate savings, and poor investment decisions. Without accessible and supportive platforms tailored to diverse age groups, individuals may feel overwhelmed and ill-equipped to manage their finances effectively. Hence, there is an urgent need for a comprehensive online platform providing interactive learning modules, personalized recommendations, and a supportive community to promote financial literacy and empower individuals of all ages.
